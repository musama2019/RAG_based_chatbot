# RAG_based_chatbot

The RAG-based Chatbot project offers a Jupyter notebook containing a step-by-step guide to creating a chatbot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Additionally, it includes an app.py file and a requirements.txt file for running the chatbot using Python scripts.

**Key Components:**

**Jupyter Notebook**: The provided Jupyter notebook guides users through the process of creating a chatbot using the RAG framework. It includes detailed steps and code examples to facilitate understanding and implementation.

**app.py**: The app.py file contains the script for running the chatbot as a Python application. It provides the necessary functionality to interact with users and generate responses based on the RAG model.

**requirements.txt**: The requirements.txt file lists all the dependencies and libraries required to run the chatbot script. Users can install these dependencies using pip to ensure the smooth execution of the application.

**Usage:**

Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to create the RAG-based chatbot.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Execute app.py to run the chatbot application. Users can interact with the chatbot through the provided interface and receive responses generated by the RAG model.
