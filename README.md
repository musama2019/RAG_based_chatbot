# RegulAI Assistant

Imagine having a virtual assistant at your fingertips, ready to help with any question about your organization's rules and regulations. That's exactly what we created – a smart chatbot named "RegulaBot" – to make life easier for everyone in an organization. Using the latest technology called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), RegulaBot can understand your questions and give you the right answers in no time. Whether it's about company policies, compliance requirements, or specific regulations, RegulaBot has got you covered. It's like having a knowledgeable colleague available 24/7 to guide you through the ins and outs of  organization. And the best part? It's all done seamlessly through simple conversation, making it easy for everyone to stay informed and make better decisions.

**Key Components:**

**Jupyter Notebook**: The provided Jupyter notebook guides users through the process of creating a chatbot using the RAG framework. It includes detailed steps and code examples to facilitate understanding and implementation.

**app.py**: The app.py file contains the script for running the chatbot as a Python application. It provides the necessary functionality to interact with users and generate responses based on the RAG model.

**requirements.txt**: The requirements.txt file lists all the dependencies and libraries required to run the chatbot script. Users can install these dependencies using pip to ensure the smooth execution of the application.

**Usage:**
